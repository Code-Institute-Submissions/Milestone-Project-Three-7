# Milestone-Project-Three - Keep A Record

## Description

Keep a record is a site that allows users to sign up, log in and build a list of the programs and movies they have watched on they're favourite streaming services, rate them and write comments or a review.

## User Design/Experience

The goal of this project was to give users the ability to keep track of what they had watched on an easy to use platform. They could not only remind themselves of what they had watched and where it was available to watch, but also write a self review possibly saying what they liked and if they would watch it again. 
This goal was broken down into User Stories

### User Stories

- As a user I want to, have an easy way to keep track of things that I have watched.
- As a user I want to, easily find my way around the site.
- As a user I want to, be able to sign up and log in to the site to save my list for future reference.
- As a user I want to, add detail to my list items such as the name, where I watched it, details/a review about it and to give it a rating.
- As a user I want to, be able to edit entries to current list items if I want to change the name, streaming service, review or rating of it.
- As a user I want to, I want to be able to delete entries in the list that I no longer want in it.
